## 2. Definition / Idea

A Linked List is a **linear data structure** that stores elements (nodes) dynamically. Each node contains:

- **Value** (data field).
    
- **Reference (pointer)** to the next node.
    

Unlike arrays, linked lists grow dynamically and do not require contiguous memory.

## 3. Key Properties

- Dynamic size (expand/shrink easily).
    
- Insertions and deletions are efficient.
    
- No random access (sequential traversal only).
    
- May use more memory due to pointers.
    

## 4. Example Node Structure (Python)

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None  # points to next Node
```

## 5. Use Cases

- Stacks, Queues, Hash maps (chaining).
    
- Dynamic memory allocation.
    
- Polynomial representation.
    
## 6. Complexity of Linked List Operations

| **Operation**       | **Time Complexity**                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Traversal           | O(n)                                  |
| Insert at Beginning | O(1)                                  |
| Insert at End       | O(n) (without tail), O(1) (with tail) |
| Insert at Position  | O(n)                                  |
| Delete at Beginning | O(1)                                  |
| Delete at Position  | O(n)                                  |
| Search              | O(n)                                  |


## 7. Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to handle empty list.
    
- Losing reference to head.
    
- Forgetting to update pointers after insert/delete.
    
- Infinite loops from cycles.
    
- Misusing dummy node (not discarding it at the end).
