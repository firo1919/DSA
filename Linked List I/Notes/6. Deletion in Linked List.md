## 1. Delete at Beginning

- Move head to second node.
    

```python
def delete_first(head):
    if not head:
        return None
    return head.next
```

## 2. Delete at Given Position

- Traverse to node before target.
    
- Redirect `previous.next` to `current.next`.
    

```python
def delete_at_position(head, position):
    if not head:
        return None

    if position == 0:
        return head.next

    current = head
    for _ in range(position - 1):
        if not current.next:
            return head
        current = current.next
    
    if current.next:
        current.next = current.next.next
    return head
```

## 3. Dummy Node Trick

Using a dummy node also simplifies deletions (especially when deleting head).
