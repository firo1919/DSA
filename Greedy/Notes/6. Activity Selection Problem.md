- **Problem:** Maximize the number of non-overlapping activities.
    
- **Approach:** Always pick the activity that finishes earliest.
    
### Greedy Algorithm

1. Sort activities by finish time.
    
2. Pick the first activity.
    
3. For each subsequent activity, if its start â‰¥ last finish, select it.
    

### Correctness Proof

- **Base Case:** First chosen activity can always be swapped into an optimal solution.
    
- **Inductive Step:** Assume optimality up to step k. The k+1 greedy choice still leads to optimal solution (exchange argument).
