- Problem: Give change for N using coin denominations.
    
- Heuristic: Always pick the largest coin ≤ remaining amount.
    
✅ Works for `{25, 10, 5, 1}`  
❌ Fails for `{1, 3, 4}`, target `6`

- Greedy → `{4, 1, 1}` (3 coins)
    
- Optimal → `{3, 3}` (2 coins)
    

⚠️ Lesson: **Greedy doesn’t always guarantee global optimum.**
