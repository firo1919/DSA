- You have `N` dollars to make using given coin denominations.
    
- Use the fewest number of coins possible.
    

### Example

Target: `87` with coins `{25, 10, 5, 1}`

- Feasible Solution 1: `87 × 1` → ❌ not minimal
    
- Feasible Solution 2: `8 × 10 + 7 × 1` → ❌ not minimal
    
- Optimal Solution: `{25, 25, 25, 10, 1, 1}` → ✅ 6 coins
