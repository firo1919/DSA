## 1. Definition / Idea

A **greedy algorithm** builds up a solution step by step, making the **locally optimal choice** at each stage, with the hope that these choices lead to a global optimum.
## 2. Key Properties

- **Greedy Choice Property** – At each step, choose the best available option without reconsidering.
    
- **Optimal Substructure** – An optimal solution to the whole problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of subproblems.
    
## 3. Greedy Pitfalls & Weaknesses

1. Greedy choice may not lead to global optimum.
    
2. Ignores future consequences.
    
3. Often depends on correct sorting.
    
4. Proof of correctness can be difficult.
