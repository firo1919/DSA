## 2. Definition / Idea

A **greedy algorithm** builds up a solution step by step, making the **locally optimal choice** at each stage, with the hope that these choices lead to a global optimum.

## 3. Key Properties

- **Greedy Choice Property** ‚Äì At each step, choose the best available option without reconsidering.
    
- **Optimal Substructure** ‚Äì An optimal solution to the whole problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of subproblems.

**Motivating Problem ‚Äì Coin Collector‚Äôs Dilemma**

- You have `N` dollars to make using given coin denominations.
    
- Use the fewest number of coins possible.
    

### Example

Target: `87` with coins `{25, 10, 5, 1}`

- Feasible Solution 1: `87 √ó 1` ‚Üí ‚ùå not minimal
    
- Feasible Solution 2: `8 √ó 10 + 7 √ó 1` ‚Üí ‚ùå not minimal
    
- Optimal Solution: `{25, 25, 25, 10, 1, 1}` ‚Üí ‚úÖ 6 coins

**Optimization Problems**

- **Definition:** Problems where the goal is to find the _best_ solution among feasible ones.
    
- **Components:**
    
    1. **Objective Function** ‚Äì Minimize or maximize something (e.g., minimize coins).
        
    2. **Decision Variables** ‚Äì Choices that affect the outcome (e.g., coin denominations used).
        
    3. **Constraints** ‚Äì Restrictions (e.g., sum of coins = N).

**Greedy Terms**

- **Subproblem** ‚Äì A smaller instance of the original problem.
    
- **Local Optimum** ‚Äì Best choice in the current step.
    
- **Global Optimum** ‚Äì Best solution overall.
    
- **Selection Rule** ‚Äì Guides which option to choose next.
    
- **Heuristic** ‚Äì Practical rule/shortcut for making choices efficiently.
    
- **Termination Condition** ‚Äì When to stop the algorithm (e.g., when target is reached).

**Greedy Example ‚Äì Heuristic**

- Problem: Give change for N using coin denominations.
    
- Heuristic: Always pick the largest coin ‚â§ remaining amount.
    

‚úÖ Works for `{25, 10, 5, 1}`  
‚ùå Fails for `{1, 3, 4}`, target `6`

- Greedy ‚Üí `{4, 1, 1}` (3 coins)
    
- Optimal ‚Üí `{3, 3}` (2 coins)
    

‚ö†Ô∏è Lesson: **Greedy doesn‚Äôt always guarantee global optimum.**

**Activity Selection Problem**

- **Problem:** Maximize the number of non-overlapping activities.
    
- **Approach:** Always pick the activity that finishes earliest.
    

### Greedy Algorithm

1. Sort activities by finish time.
    
2. Pick the first activity.
    
3. For each subsequent activity, if its start ‚â• last finish, select it.
    

### Correctness Proof

- **Base Case:** First chosen activity can always be swapped into an optimal solution.
    
- **Inductive Step:** Assume optimality up to step k. The k+1 greedy choice still leads to optimal solution (exchange argument).

‚úÖ That completes the **Greedy Algorithms** lecture notes:

- Coin Collector‚Äôs Dilemma (motivation)
    
- Optimization problem basics
    
- Greedy terms and heuristics
    
- Coin system example (works/fails)
    
- Activity Selection Problem + Proof
    
- Pitfalls of greedy methods
    
- Practice problems
    

Would you like me to also prepare a **cheat sheet of greedy strategies** (coin change, interval scheduling, Huffman coding, Kruskal‚Äôs MST, etc.), or keep these strictly lecture-based?
