## 1. Definition / Idea

Two pointers start from opposite ends of a sorted array and move toward each other, typically used in sum or search problems.

## 2. Key Properties

- Works on **sorted arrays**.
    
- Eliminates need for nested loops.
    

## 3. Steps / Working

1. Initialize left at 0, right at end.
    
2. Compute sum of elements at left and right.
    
3. If sum too small → move left forward.
    
4. If sum too large → move right backward.
    
5. If equal to target → return result.
    

## 4. Example (Python) – Two Sum in Sorted Array

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while left < right:
        s = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if s < target:
            left += 1
        elif s > target:
            right -= 1
        else:
            return [nums[left], nums[right]]
    return []
```

## 5. Use Cases

- Two Sum problem.
    
- Finding pairs with constraints.
    
- Palindrome checking in strings.
    

## 6. Variations / Related Concepts

- Three pointers → extended to 3SUM.
    

## 7. Common Mistakes & Pitfalls

- Forgetting input must be sorted.
    
- Returning indices instead of values (or vice versa).
