## 1. Definition / Idea

The Two Pointers technique uses two indices (pointers) to traverse an array, string, or two arrays simultaneously, reducing time and space complexity compared to brute-force approaches.

## 2. Key Properties

- Works best with **linear data structures** (arrays, strings, linked lists).
    
- Often applied when input data is **sorted**.
    
- Pointers can move in different patterns (parallel, colliding, seeker/holder).
    

## 3. Steps / Working

1. Initialize two indices.
    
2. Move them in a controlled manner (same direction, opposite ends, or dependent).
    
3. Stop when a condition is met or pointers cross boundaries.
    

## 4. Example (Python) â€“ Checking if array is sorted

```python
def is_sorted(nums):
    left, right = 0, 1
    while right < len(nums):
        if nums[left] > nums[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right += 1
    return True
```

## 5. Use Cases

- Sorted array checks.
    
- Merging sorted arrays.
    
- Pair sum problems.
    
- Rearranging elements in-place.
    

## 6. Variations / Related Concepts

- Parallel Pointers
    
- Pointers on Separate Arrays
    
- Colliding Pointers
    
- Seeker and Placeholder
    
- For-While Combo
    

## 7. Common Mistakes & Pitfalls

- **Index out of bounds** from wrong loop conditions.
    
- Mismanaging stopping criteria (e.g., `while left < right` vs `<=`).
    
- Forgetting to handle edge cases (empty or single-element arrays).
