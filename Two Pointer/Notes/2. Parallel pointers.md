## 1. Definition / Idea

Both pointers move forward simultaneously, often used to check relationships between consecutive elements.

## 2. Key Properties

- Efficient O(n) scanning.
    
- Best for consecutive comparisons.
    

## 3. Steps / Working

1. Place two pointers at consecutive indices.
    
2. Compare their values.
    
3. Move both forward in parallel until end of array.
    

## 4. Example (Python) â€“ Check if sorted

```python
def is_sorted(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

## 5. Use Cases

- Verify sorted order.
    
- Detect consecutive patterns.
    

## 6. Variations / Related Concepts

- Extension: Can skip forward by more than 1 step.
    

## 7. Common Mistakes & Pitfalls

- Forgetting last element check.
    
- Using extra space unnecessarily when a linear scan suffices.
