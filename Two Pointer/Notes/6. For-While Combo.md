## 1. Definition / Idea

One pointer advances one step at a time (for-loop), while the other advances multiple steps as needed (while-loop). Useful when one pointer’s position depends on the other.

## 2. Key Properties

- Effective for **comparisons across two sorted arrays**.
    
- O(n + m) complexity.
    

## 3. Steps / Working

1. Iterate over array B (for-loop).
    
2. For each element, move pointer in array A (while-loop) until condition fails.
    
3. Record results.
    

## 4. Example (Python) – Count Elements Smaller than Each in Second Array

```python
def count_smaller(nums1, nums2):
    result = []
    i = 0
    for num in nums2:
        while i < len(nums1) and nums1[i] < num:
            i += 1
        result.append(i)
    return result
```

## 5. Use Cases

- Frequency comparisons.
- Cumulative counting problems.
## 6. Variations / Related Concepts

- Two pointers + binary search hybrid.
## 7. Common Mistakes & Pitfalls

- Resetting pointer unnecessarily instead of continuing.
    
- Wrong condition for moving the while-pointer.
