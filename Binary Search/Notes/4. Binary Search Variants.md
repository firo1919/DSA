### 1. Over Input Space

Directly searching within the input array.

### 2. Over Output Space

Searching within the space of possible answers (e.g., minimum ship capacity, minimum speed).

## Example (Python) â€“ Binary Search on Output Space

```python
def min_capacity(weights, days):
    low, high = max(weights), sum(weights)

    def feasible(cap):
        days_used, curr = 1, 0
        for w in weights:
            if curr + w > cap:
                days_used += 1
                curr = 0
            curr += w
        return days_used <= days

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if feasible(mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return low
```
