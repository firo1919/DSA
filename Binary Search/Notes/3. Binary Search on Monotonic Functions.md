## 1. Definition / Idea

Binary Search is not limited to arrays. It works on any **monotonic function** (function that is entirely non-decreasing or non-increasing).

## 2. Examples

- Square root approximation.
    
- Finding smallest/largest subarray satisfying condition.
    
- Prefix sum optimizations.
    

## 3. Example (Python) â€“ Integer Square Root

```python
def integer_sqrt(x):
    low, high = 0, x
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if mid * mid <= x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return high
```
