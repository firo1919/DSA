## 1. Problem

Given a singly linked list, remove the n-th node from the end.  
[Leetcode 19](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

## 2. Approaches

### Approach I – Two Pass

1. Count total nodes `k`.
    
2. Find `(k-n)`th node.
    
3. Remove the next node.
    

### Approach II – One Pass (Two Pointers)

1. Move `ahead` pointer `n` steps forward.
    
2. Start `behind` from head.
    
3. Move both until `ahead` reaches end.
    
4. `behind` now points to the target node.
    

## 3. Example (Python)

```python
def removeNthFromEnd(head, n):
    dummy = ListNode(0, head)
    ahead = behind = dummy

    # Move ahead n+1 steps
    for _ in range(n+1):
        ahead = ahead.next

    # Move both pointers
    while ahead:
        ahead = ahead.next
        behind = behind.next

    # Remove node
    behind.next = behind.next.next
    return dummy.next
```
