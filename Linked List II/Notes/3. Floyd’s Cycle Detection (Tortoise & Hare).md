## 1. Problem

Detect if a linked list has a cycle and return the node where it begins.  
[Leetcode 142](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)
## 2. Approach

- **Phase I – Cycle Detection**
    
    - `slow` moves one step, `fast` moves two steps.
        
    - If they meet, a cycle exists.
        
- **Phase II – Find Cycle Entrance**
    
    - Reset `slow` to head.
        
    - Move both `slow` and `fast` one step at a time.
        
    - They meet at the cycle start.
        
## 3. Example (Python)

```python
def detectCycle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    
    # Phase I: detect cycle
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            break
    else:
        return None
    
    # Phase II: find entrance
    slow = head
    while slow != fast:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next
    return slow
```
