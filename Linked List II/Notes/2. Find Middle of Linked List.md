## 1. Problem

Return the middle node of a singly linked list.  
[Leetcode 876](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

## 2. Approach â€“ Fast and Slow Pointers

- `slow` moves one step.
    
- `fast` moves two steps.
    
- When `fast` reaches end, `slow` is at middle.
    

## 3. Example (Python)

```python
def middleNode(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow
```
