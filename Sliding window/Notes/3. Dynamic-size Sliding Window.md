## 1. Topic

**Dynamic-size Sliding Window**

## 2. Definition / Idea

The window expands and shrinks depending on problem conditions (like uniqueness or sum constraints).

## 3. Key Properties

- Flexible size.
    
- Works well for substring/sequence constraints.
    
- Still linear time O(n).
    

## 4. Steps / Working

1. Expand right pointer until condition is violated.
    
2. Shrink left pointer until condition is valid again.
    
3. Track results during this process.
    

## 5. Example (Python) â€“ Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    window = set()
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in window:  # shrink if duplicate found
            window.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        window.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

## 6. Use Cases

- Longest substring problems.
    
- Subarrays with sum constraints.
    
- At most/at least `k` distinct elements.
    

## 7. Variations / Related Concepts

- General templates for "at most" and "at least" window problems.
    

## 8. Common Mistakes & Pitfalls

- Not shrinking window properly when condition breaks.
    
- Forgetting to update results before/after shrinking.
