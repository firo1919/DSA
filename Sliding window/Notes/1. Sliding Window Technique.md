## 1. Definition / Idea

The sliding window technique is used for solving array and string problems by maintaining a subrange ("window") and moving it efficiently. Instead of recalculating results from scratch for each subarray, the window reuses information, achieving linear time solutions.

## 2. Key Properties

- Two types: **Fixed-size window** and **Dynamic-size window**.
    
- Windows can expand, shrink, or move based on conditions.
    
- Eliminates nested loops in many problems.
    

## 3. Steps / Working

1. Define a window size or condition.
    
2. Move the window over the input structure.
    
3. Update results as elements enter or leave the window.
    

## 4. Example (Python) â€“ Motivation Problem (Max sum of 3 consecutive numbers)

```python
def max_sum_subarray(nums, k):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    window_sum = 0

    # Compute initial window sum
    for i in range(k):
        window_sum += nums[i]
    max_sum = window_sum

    # Slide window
    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        window_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]  # update efficiently
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)

    return max_sum
```

## 5. Use Cases

- Optimization problems (max/min values).
    
- Counting occurrences (e.g., anagrams).
    
- Pattern detection in arrays/strings.

## 6. Variations / Related Concepts

- Fixed-size window.
    
- Dynamic-size window.
    
- Counting-based sliding window.
    
- Two-dimensional sliding window.

## 7. Common Mistakes & Pitfalls

- Off-by-one errors in index handling.
    
- Forgetting to update both entry and exit of window.
    
- Mishandling edge cases (empty arrays, window > array size).
## 8. Time and Space complexity

- **Fixed-size window:**
    
    - Time: O(n)
        
    - Space: O(1)
        
- **Dynamic-size window:**
    
    - Time: O(n)
        
    - Space: O(1)
        
- **Counting window:**
    
    - Time: O(n)
        
    - Space: O(1) / O(k) depending on alphabet
        
- **Two-dimensional window:**
    
    - Time: O(n * m)
        
    - Space: O(1)
