## 1. Definition / Idea

Instead of updating a full range, use a difference array and take prefix sum later.

## 2. Example (Python) â€“ Update Range [l, r] by k

```python
def range_update(nums, queries):
    diff = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
    for l, r, k in queries:
        diff[l] += k
        if r+1 < len(diff):
            diff[r+1] -= k

    # Apply prefix sum to get updated array
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        diff[i] += diff[i-1]
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums[i] += diff[i]

    return nums
```
