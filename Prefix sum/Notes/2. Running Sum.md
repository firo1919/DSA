## 1. Definition / Idea

A running sum maintains a continuously updated cumulative total as new elements are added.

## 2. Key Properties

- No need to store the entire sequence.
    
- Can provide sum at any point instantly.
    

## 3. Steps / Working

1. Initialize `running_sum = 0`.
    
2. For each element, add it to `running_sum`.
    

## 4. Example (Python)

```python
def running_sum(nums):
    total = 0
    result = []
    for num in nums:
        total += num
        result.append(total)
    return result
```

## 5. Use Cases

- Real-time summation.
    
- Prefix base cases.
    

## 6. Variations / Related Concepts

- Used as building block for prefix sums.
    

## 7. Common Mistakes & Pitfalls

- Misinterpreting as separate data structure.
